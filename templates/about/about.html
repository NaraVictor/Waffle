        Learning communities are similar to Facebook pages in concept but optimized for teaching and learning. Users can
        follow or create a community and these communities could hold live sessions, create and post content local to
        the community for instance, there could be a community about the culture and history of Lawra (a town in upper
        west of Ghana) and much more.
